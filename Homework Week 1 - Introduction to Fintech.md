### When was the company incorporated?

 Established in November 2016 as a joint venture between Norwegian mobile operator Telenor Group, Yoma Bank, and SGX-listed Yoma Strategic Holdings (YSH) and Yangon-listed First Myanmar Investment (FMI), the last three related entities of Serge Pun's Myanmar property, industry and finance onglomerate.  [1] It is 'Myanmar’s first mobile financial service provider and now the largest mobile money platform in the country.' [7a]

### Who are the founders of the company?

Telenor is a 166 year old 'Norwegian majority state-owned multinational telecommunications company headquartered at Fornebu in Bærum, close to Oslo. It is one of the world's largest mobile telecommunications companies with operations worldwide, but focused in Scandinavia and Asia.' [2] In Mynmar Telenor has 747 employees (as at 2020) with 16.23 million mobile subscriptions. Telenor passed a major milestone with the signing of the nationwide telecommunications license agreement with the Myanmar government on 30 January 2014. Telenor was declared a successful application for the license on June 27, 2013, followed by a license negotiation process. [2a] In July 2020, Telenor announced its divestment of Wave Money to Yoma Strategic Holdings (Wave Holdco) while still remaining a strategic partner for its Telenor Myanmar communications services. 

Yoma Bank Limited is one of Myanmar's largest commercial banking companies founded in 1993, the 4th-biggest bank in Myanmar in 25 cities, it is led by New Zealander Dean Cleland with 80 branches across Myanmar, 3000 employees and was founded by Serge Pun. First Myanmar Investment is a major Myanmar investment company founded in 1992 as one of Myanmar's first publicly traded companies. [4] It is a subsidiary of Serge Pun & Assoc. and the company's headquarters are located in Pabedan Township, Yangon. Real estate contributes to 87% of FMI's revenue. [3] 

Property mogul Serge Pun chairs Yoma Strategic Holdings, a Singapore-listed outfit with real estate holdings in his native Myanmar. Pun is the son of a Chinese-born banker, who left Myanmar with his family in 1965 for Beijing. Pun's Yoma Bank has among the largest branch networks in Myanmar. His Yangon-listed First Myanmar Investment has interests in financial services, healthcare and real estate. [5] [5a] An assessment of the top 10 conglomerates of Myanmar found Yoma, as a subsidiary of SPA (and its leading copmany First Myanmar Investment Group), to be comparatively low in connection to and potential cronyism with the military government, while being comparartively high in foreign contacts, and medium to high in competence and strategy. [8]

### How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

 A 2015 Asian Development Bank Economics Working Paper indicated that 'rural areas have limited access to banking services, and bank lending to agriculture is largely restricted to the state-owned Myanma Agricultural Development Bank, which faces financial and operational challenges of its own and covers only a small share of the financing needs of farmers. [6] The country has had a continuing and relentless history of economic shocks stretching back from its foundation in in 1948, exacerbated by the military coups from 1962 onwards, culminating in the latest unrest and violence in February 2021 to now. [7]  The legacy of the past has included nationalisation of banks, de-monetization, partial liberalisation and the expansion of banks, the banking crisis of 2004, the bank closure of Univesal Bank and minicrisis of 2012 with a run on KBZ bank further destabilising the finance sector. All this history provided a complete lack of public trust in the banking system. As a joint venture company, Wave Money was founded to offer customers online mobile banking and at the heart of it, offer the convenience of sending and receiving money instantly and safely throughout Myanmar.

Yoma Bank itself, the part owner of Wave Monay, was the second largest private bank in 2003, but following the banking crisis of that year, had to resort to emergency financing from the Central Bank of Mynmar and consequently had its operations restricted to remittance transfers only. These restictions were lifted in 2012 allowing Yoma to joint venture in Wave Money in 2015 [6]. Yoma Bank is one of the Myanmar’s largest private banks employing more than 3,000 people.  'Established in 1993, Yoma Bank strategic direction 'aims to become a leader in serving the small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) sector, and reach businesses that significantly contribute to the local economy and build up local communities.' [7a] Hence, an opportuninty to launch Wave Money as a mobile banking platform to its customers together the backing of Telenor, a telecommunications and technology company experienced in developing Asian markets, is assumed to have been a natural fit.

### How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

Wave Money was established in 2016 with a 51% stake by Telenor, with the remaining stake owned by the Serge Pun (SPA) related companies Yoma and FMI. Telenor sold its entire stake to Yoma Strategic Holdings for US$76.5m in 2020 [32]. 

As a joint venbture it is difficult to find exact numbers for the intial seeding. A review of Telenor financials statements from 2016, only finds a comment that 'In emerging Asia, solid revenue growth was fuelled by increasing data consumption; while we continued to focus on network roll-outs and saw Myanmar turning cash flow positive, only two years after service launch' to rapidly become the #2 operator in the country. There is no specific investment number.

A review of the Yoma Bank 2016 financial statemens spruke the Wave Money platform as the first licenced mobile money service in Myanmar, the largest and wide spread platform with an estimated market penetration to be over 70%, and importantly, Yoma and Wave interchangeable services including account linkage, direct fund transfer and Yoma account withdrawals through Wave vendors [36]. Page 77 of the 2016 financial report refers to a 2,364,930,800 MMK investment securities in Myanmar Digital Money "Available for Sale Securities' which converts to approximately at 1262 MMK per US dollar on 30/9/2016 cross rates (xe.com historical rates tables) at USD$1.84m.

In May 2020 it was announced that Chinese based Alipay operator Ant Group would become a strategic investor in Wave Money, a deal that will be completed on final regulatory approval, bringing a USDS$73.5 investment for 33% of the company [31]. While Telenor was the major technology develoipment partner for the venture, with the mobile infrastructure established, the change over to Ant group would bring financial tehcnology expertise to support the further growth of the business. As at May 2021, this planned investment by Ant Group has fallen through, with the continued unrest in Myanmar which commenced in February, with no resolution in sight at this time (May 2021). Yoma Banks has since announced that the long stop dates (long stop dates are where if contractual conditions are not ultimately fulfilled by the due dates, automatically termination of the contract occurs) on the transactions in relation to Wave Money with Ant Financial and Yoma Strategic will not be extended due to the unrest in Myanmar. The agreements were announced on 24 June 2020 but have not yet been completed, and the parties will continue to evaluate the situation, but not be formally bound by the agreements after 30 April 2021.

## Business Activities:

### What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

The company originally hoped to revolutionlise mobile financial services in one of Asia's poorest countries, headed by CEO Brad Jones, an ex-NAB former director of mobile money and innovation at VISA Singapore, by offering free app based funds transfer across the country. Wave Money states its vision is "Creating a fairer future for Myanmar, empower Myanmar people with the freedom to manage their money the way they most prefer".

### Introducing basic financial online services

Wave Money aims at the banking basics, utlilising online technologies to "provide reliable, simple, affordable, and trustworthy financial services which can be conveniently accessed via mobile phones and our extensive agent network", in a country where banking trust is low, and infrastructure such as utilities, roads and technology are underdeveloped, and movement of money is difficult, with a low trust in cash. [9] Prior to 2014, Myanmar had extremely limited and archaic mobile infrastructure with a penetration of 7% of the population. In 2013, after the government committed to expanding the mobile network, penetration grew to 50% by 2015 after the country quickly adopted 2G, then 3G within twelve months, before rolling out 4G, providing the foundation for rapid fintech expansion [14].

A review of the Telenor financial statements of 2014 posted 'Perhaps this year’s greatest transformation happened in Myanmar, where millions of people discovered the power of mobile connectivity. It is here, in this relatively untapped market, that we can truly see the enormous impact of a mobile phone and how it can empower societies. Myanmar has skipped the traditional development path seen in more mature markets and is leapfrogging directly into the digital age. The internet is mobile, and with it comes both economic and social possibilities with tremendous development potential."

### Developing the local insfrastructure to support Wave Money rollout

The 2015 Telenor financial statements reveal "Financial services: During the year, Telenor launched digital mobile money in its newest market Myanmar. Commercial testing commenced in December and financial services will be offered through 800 point-of-sales under the brand “Wave Money”. The report goes in to say 'A country like Myanmar, where internet connectivity was made widely available over mobile networks only in late 2014, access is already comparable to advanced markets like Malaysia and Sweden', and reported positive EDITDA only a few months after service launch. Telenor state their exapnsion continues to be driven by M2M technology or 'machine-to-machine', which is "a broad label that can be used to describe any technology that enables networked devices to exchange information and perform actions without the manual assistance of humans. ... M2M has since found applications in other sectors, such as healthcare, business and insurance" [35] [36].

### Supporting women's rights and economic development

In June 2018, with support from the United Nations Capital Development Fund and Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Wave Money launched Shwe Toe, "a financial education gamification app that aims to help young women with a better understanding of financial concepts" [10] 

In March 2019, Wave Money collaborated with Myanmar Economic Bank to provide mobile pension payments to government pensioners.[8]


As of September 2019, Wave Money had over 68,000 agents in almost every region in Myanmar. 


 ### Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?



### What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

FMI's 2016 financial statements announced 'Future Launch of Wave Money The Company, Yoma Bank, and our joint venture partner Telenor are planning to launch the revolutionary Wave Money mobile payment platform. Wave Money allows customers to securely store and transfer money using just their mobile phones. After downloading the Wave Money mobile app, customers can visit a nearby Wave Shop to deposit or withdraw cash. Wave Shops include local grocery stores, mobile phone shops, teashops and convenience stores. Wave Money is available 24/7 on your phone, so there’s no need to wait for the bank to open to transfer money. Transactions are processed instantly, resulting in a fast, efficient service. I would encourage all FMI shareholders to download the app once it’s available and try out the service, I think you’ll be glad you did. [39] Page 23 stated 'Yoma Bank believes that Myanmar’s financial sector will benefit from global trends in technology and innovation. We have laid the foundations for future growth through the procurement of a new core banking system and the development of our partnership with Telenor to establish Wave Money. Yoma Bank expects to use digital channels to offer modern banking services to improve financial inclusion across Myanmar in an affordable and convenient manner. The efficiencies of technology allow the bank to scale its offering to those that have not traditionally been able to access interest bearing products or receive credit'.

The key to this early success was the colloration between the country's second largest mobile communcations company, one of the country's largest banks using a wide newtwork of existing branches to support the rollout, and recruiting and utilising a large network of small businesses on an agency basis to facilitate the conversion of online money to cash in hand.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?


 At the same time we must be aware of the possible challenges related to the increased use of mobile and internet services. Issues related to privacy, cyber-security and political monitoring are all high on the global agenda. These are complex issues that need to be handled by our industry and society at large. 


* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?

 Wave Money's success has been tied closely to the adoption of mobile intnert within the country. At the end of 2014, Telenor Myanmar, as the second laregest mmobile provider, had 3.4 million mobile subscribers. [34]  This rapid technology adoption and expansion in Myanmar paved the way for the launch of further financial services for Wave Money.

## Recommendations

### If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)


Recommendation 1 - Expansion of online offers into customer micro-finance options

Part of the initial success of Wave Money was the fast and ingrated set up of the core banking systems by Telenor in partnership with Yoma Bank, its Myanmar partner. Telenor has experience with microfinancing within its subsidiary Telenor Microfinance Bank based in neighbouring Pakistan, jointly owned with Ant Group (Alibaba group) who are the new proposed owners of Wave Money whose investment is currently on hold pending the unrest in Mymar [77]. 

Without stating the obvious, services provide by this company could be replicated into Wave Money to provide financing options for small businesses, particulary given the decentralised agrarian nature opf the vcountrry. A Telenor Microfinance Bank product called "Easypaisa" operates as a branchless banking service. Easypaisa is driven by the bank's vision and mission of transforming the financial landscape of the country and providing instant access to convenient digital financial services, The company's services include micro-finance and related financial services to the less privileged and unbanked segment of the society, intended to contribute to the radication of poverty in Pakistan. Ant Group's investment in Wave Money could expand these opportunities quickly.

Recommendation 2 - 

Recommendation 3 - Continuity of service

Finally, a left field big idea. From a business perspective, Myanmar has a history of challenging political, economic, social and technological environment.  Politically, the disruption by the history of military coups and associated environmental uncertainty around the economic and legal framework which we take for granted within Australia, has meant that businesses have had to develop markets and operate day to day activities with a high level of risk and instability. Operating in a space of finance and technology, Wave Money is heavily reliant on the consistent and steady functioning of the country mobile infrastructure and internet providers. Telenor, a key provider of mobileinfrastructure and major partner in the Wave Money platform, has stated through their spokesperson Catherine Stand Lund, "we are worried about the situation in Myanmar. We have seen the difference access to communication technology can make in reducing inequalities and contributing to inclusive growth, and we want to contribute to the country’s progress"  [Why is Myanmar’s military blocking the internet?] 

One of the particularly challenging aspects for a fintech operating in a country such as Myanmar is the military ruling government's capacity and willingness to shut down the Internet and heavily censor and vet the activities within the country.  James Griffiths noted to Al Jezeera that, "such blocks are relatively easy to achieve, especially when the government controls ISPs [internet service providers] which in the case of a military junta we must assume they do physically even if they don’t legally". The country's recent move in 2021 to implement new cyber-security laws would provide the military with unlimited power to access user data. Telenor has made a name for itself as the 'only transparent telecommunications company in Myanmar, providing regular updates on orders and directives it received from authorities, even ones it disagreed with.' On February 14 this year, hours before the internet shutdown, that came to an end. “It is currently not possible for Telenor to disclose the directives we receive from the authorities,” Telenor said in a statement, adding it was “gravely concerned by this development”'.

A possible avenue Wave Money could consider longer term is to continue to provide uninterrupted services to its customer base through the establishment of a low cost small satellite technology network similar to Starlink. Starlink provides "high-speed, low latency broadband internet, delivering initial beta service both domestically and internationally, and will continue expansion to near global coverage of the populated world in 2021. During beta, users can expect to see data speeds vary from 50Mb/s to 150Mb/s and latency from 20ms to 40ms in most locations over the next several months as we enhance the Starlink system.' This kind of technology can provide cross border stable internet access, operating outside of the internal country's ISP network, this kind of set up could be administered from Telenor's neighbouring operations in Malaysia or another technology hub, allowing its Wave Money platform to continue to provide basic online transactional continuity. If worked and limited to financial services only, the military government's impact to this type of activity could be managed, particularly given the political and financial strength of Serge Pun, and the transactional flow of money on the Wave Money platform could continue unimpeded by political unrest. Currently there are a multitude of space companies that are devloping low costs satellite access including Tesla and a new NZ based company Rocketlab, which has sending low cost low orbit payloads for over two years. A company such Telenor could investigate leasing or procuring this types of technologies to support Wave Money.

Myanmar with its underdeveloped infrastructure and politicql unrest is a place that is difficult for small business owners to find and secure micro financing. Microfinance is a banking service provided to unemployed or low-income individuals or groups who otherwise would have no other access to financial services. It allows people to take on reasonable small business loans safely, and in a manner that is consistent with ethical lending practices. Over time, microfinance has emerged as a larger movement whose object is: "a world in which as everyone, especially the poor and socially marginalized people and households have access to a wide range of affordable, high quality financial products and services, including not just credit but also savings, insurance, payment services, and fund transfers."

Digital Money Myanmar Limited (Wave Money)

In Myanmar, we see an irregular, uncertain, and deeply concerning situation. Since the military coup on 1 February 2021 has been on the security for our employees, access to services for customers and continued transparency. Prolonged mobile internet restrictions have severely connectivity services. Telenor calls on the authorities to immediately reinstate unimpeded communications and respect the right to freedom of expression and human rights. Due to the worsening of economic and business environment outlook and a deteriorating security and human rights situation, we see limited prospects of improvement going forward. Based on this, we have fully impaired Telenor Myanmar with an amount of NOK 6.5 billion in the quarter. With limited visibility on the development in the country, we have excluded Myanmar from our outlook. For the full year 2021, excluding Myanmar, we re-iterate the expectation of organic subscription and traffic revenues and EBITDA to remain around the 2020 level and a capex to sales ratio of 15-16%.
